Acute stress drives global repression through two independent RNA polymerase II stalling events in Saccharomyces
Unlike metzoans, transcription in budding yeast proceeds rapidly from start to end. However, Badjatia et al. now show that acute stress causes Pol II to stall at two primary locations at the 5' ends of most yeast genes. Stalling may facilitate rapid gene silencing, which promotes stress-induced gene-specific reprogramming.
Highlights
Acute stress causes promoter-proximal Pol II stalling at most yeast genes
Pol II maintains an open bubble but stops transcribing d Stalling occurs at two locations: at promoters and at +2
nucleosomes
Stalling precedes stress-induced gene reprogramming
